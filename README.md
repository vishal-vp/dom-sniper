# DOM Delete
Remove DOM elements from the page by clicking on them. Install the firefox extension [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/html-sniper/).

## How to use?
  1. Once the page is loaded click on the extension icon in the toolbar.
  2. You can hover on the HTML element you want to delete. The element will be highlighted in green.
  3. When you click on the element the element will be deleted. Actually it will be hidden instead of being deleted, virtually removing it from the display.
  4. You can click on the toolbar icon again or press ESC key to return to normal mode.
  5. Undo operations are also supported. Press CTRL + Z to undo any deletes you make to the web page.
